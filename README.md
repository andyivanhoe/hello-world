Working through GitHub Guide

I have learnt a bit of MATLAB code from completing SysMIC module 1 and am halfway through completing SysMIC module 2. This exposed me to coding directly, although I have had the desire to learn how to code for years, but (foolishly) never got started. However, my short term goal is to complete LPTHW so that I know more about how programming works. I feel that this will make completing SysMIC module 2 more meaningful, as it is really a course on systems biology, that uses programming, rather than teaching you how to code.
